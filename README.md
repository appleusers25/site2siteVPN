Hi,

this is a Site 2 Site VPN service for the CISCO Network Service Orchestration (NSO).

Cisco Network Services Orchestrator enabled by Tail-fÂ® is an industry-leading orchestration platform for hybrid networks. It provides comprehensive lifecycle service automation to enable you to design and deliver high-quality services faster and more easily.

My Lab environment will use following tools/operating systems/software:
* GNS3 Graphical Network Simulator
* Virtualbox
* Linux CentOS 7
* NSO
* Itential Pronghorn

## GNS3 
GNS3 is a Graphical Network Simulator. This tool allows easy network mapping and testing. To do this, the corresponding router or vms must be added to GNS3. For more information, visit GNS3's official [website](https://www.gns3.com/)
